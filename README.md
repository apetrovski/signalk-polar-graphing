This is the front end to be used in conjunction with https://github.com/joabakk/signalk-polar (the backend).

A simple highcharts based polar diagram that gets updated Signal K data from the server and searches for database entries for similar wind conditions to create a dynamic polar diagram based on current conditions and historic sailing performance.
